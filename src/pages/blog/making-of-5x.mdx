# The Making of kz-n.net 5x
## Welcome to kz-n.net {version}

After almost a year of not touching the website at all, I completely remade it in Astro in less than a week.
<br></br>
You may have hinted from this being version 5x that there was version 4x before this, And you would be correct. In fact I took a big portion of that version as a starting base for this, Mostly just the CSS for the blog though, everything else was remade from scratch.
<br></br>

<div className="blog-comparison">

    <p className="font-mono">As you can see, I clearly reused the design from my old website, however apart from that the rest is made from scratch.</p>
</div>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
It all started with me trying to copy the branding I've had for a while now, I wanted the website to literally be in the clouds, And that's the reason behind this background
<br></br>
<br></br>
<div className="blog-comparison">
    <p className="font-mono">Initially though, I didn't know how to make a seamless image and have it repeat infintely with CSS, so I had to zoom it in infinitely which looked garbage,</p>

</div>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<div className="blog-comparison">
    <img className="blog-comparison-img" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/928063179622334465/1147944380804644964/image.png?width=515&height=249"></img>
    <p className="font-mono">and zooming in also meant having a seam at some zoom point.</p>
</div>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
I later realized I could make a seamless image, and I did. Add to that a tremendously big width and height (hidden overflow of course) and a repeating flag and boom. Try zooming or resizing the page, It *should* remain the same.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
Apart from that, I used to use a lot of mix-blend-mode in CSS, that made the effect 10x better cause the text on the page would respond to changes in the background.
<br></br>
Unfortunately that ruined everything that wasn't text as it was also being mixed with the background, and I found no sane way to get it to work as expected.
So for now only the top bar effectively uses it
<div className="blog-comparison">
    <p className="font-mono">My favourite part of development has definitely been making the index page, This is heavily inspired by my friend Flint's <a style="font-size: 110%" class="dream-text font-mono mix-difference" href="https://fl1nt.dev">website</a>, as I first saw the music playing status on his page.</p>

</div>
<br></br>

This is all, it is a pretty simple website, I hope you enjoy it though - lol.
